[KairosDB](http://kairosdb.github.io/) Erlang Client

:warning: **WIP. Do not use yet.**

## Roadmap / planned features:

1. Inserting metrics:
  - pool of raw tcp clients (aka [`telnet API`](http://kairosdb.github.io/kairosdocs/telnetapi/index.html))
  - schedules ELB-friendly "ping", prevents corporate firewalls from killing idle connections
  
2. Retreiving metrics and aggregations:
  - [REST API](http://kairosdb.github.io/kairosdocs/restapi/index.html) wrappers
  - API for building [metrics queries](http://kairosdb.github.io/kairosdocs/restapi/QueryMetrics.html)
  
3. [pre-aggregation](http://kairosdb.github.io/kairosdocs/FAQ.html#why-would-i-pre-aggregate) facility

4. benchmarks / load-testing tools

### Detailed implementation status

- [x] Configuration
  - [x] Telnet port
  - [x] Telnet host
  - [x] Pool size
  - [x] Ping interval
  - [x] REST API port
  - [x] REST API host

- [x] Pool of telnet clients
   - [x] Insert data points
   - [x] Query version
   - [x] Auto-reconnect
       - [ ] Proper back-off on connection errors (currently each connection is delayed to prevent reconnections at the same time)
   - [x] ELB friendly keep-alive (each connection queries KairosDB for version once in a while)

- [ ] REST API (adding data points is not planned, there is no good reason to do it within the scope of this client)
-   - [ ] custom response wrappers
      - [x] delete data points
      - [x] delete metric
      - [x] list metric names
      - [x] list tag names
      - [x] list tag values
      - [ ] query metrics
          - [ ] query builder api - stable (improvements pending)
          - [ ] aggregates:
              - [x] avg
              - [x] sum
              - [ ] dev
              - [ ] div
              - [ ] histogram
              - [ ] least_squares
              - [x] max
              - [ ] min
              - [ ] rate
          - [x] tags support
          - [ ] group_by support
              - [ ] tags
              - [ ] time
